# Data Analysis Project: Customer Segmentation and Sales Optimization

## Overview
This project focuses on improving customer experience and sales performance by analyzing customer data to derive insights related to customer demographics, purchasing behaviors, and product performance.

## Key Learnings
- **Data Cleaning and Manipulation**: Cleaned raw data, handled missing values, and standardized datasets for further analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilized `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` libraries to explore relationships between variables and visualize key trends.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Identified potential customers by segmenting them across different states, occupations, genders, and age groups, which improved targeting and enhanced the customer experience.
- **Sales Insights**: Identified high-performing product categories and best-selling products to optimize inventory planning and meet customer demands effectively.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Numpy** for numerical operations

## Results
- Improved sales and customer satisfaction by segmenting and targeting customers based on demographics.
- Enhanced business decision-making by identifying product trends that drive sales and contribute to inventory planning.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis:
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://https://github.com/Stavan57/Diwali-Sales_Analysis.git
    ```
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Diwali-Sales_Analysis.ipynb
    ```

## Future Work
- Expand the analysis to include time-series data for sales forecasting.
- Implement machine learning algorithms to predict customer lifetime value and churn rates.
